This is a free website that can sit on your desktop.

Audio Reader is a program that allows you to upload a grouped file of mp3, and PDF files for a read along.
You need to have the files all in one folder when clicking the upload button because it will upload the entire folder.
Each file type will get organized to each respective collum, then all you need to do is click the chapter and mp3 and get to reading!

Also you can just add music if you want into the folder of your choosing, doesn't have to be a audiobook that just what I use it for personally.
Anything you can think of that would be a good idea to add let me know! 
You are able to use this to your hearts content, no permission needed all I ask if you use it and put your touch on it let me know I wanna try it out!
